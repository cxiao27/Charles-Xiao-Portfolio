        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The goal of this project was to design a drivetrain to convert a 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R into an electric motorcycle. Our team planned to race our bike in the AHRMA Formula Lightning competition,
                but that event was cancelled. However, we still plan on building a bike designed for racing.</li>
            <li>Since we wanted optimal performance on the track, I first wrote a Python script that modeled the different forces acting on the bike. Using differential equations, I was able to model how the bike's position changed over time</li>
            <li>The biggest challenge was working with very limited space; I tried several different configurations that ensured everything fit on the frame without interfering with the suspension or battery. The configuration I finally settled on brought the motor as low as possible and left ample room for the battery and BMS</li>
            <li>FEA and hand calcs were used to validate our design, ensuring that the components were strong enough to handle the torque and chain tension. The FEA simulation helped me identify low and high stress areas. I was able to adjust the geometry accordingly, adding material where it was needed and removing it where it wasn't.</li>

                As previously stated, our team wanted to build a high-performance superbike for AHRMA Formula Lightning. Since this is our team's first bike, our main goal was to build a functional bike capable of reaching a top speed over 100 mph.

            <h3 class="block-title">Modeling Drivetrain Dynamics for Gear Ratio Selection</h3>
            <p>
                I built a Python script that models the different forces acting on the bike during movement. The forces considered were: drag, rolling resistance, wheel force, and friction (leading to efficiency losses).
                Using this model, I created a differential equation that could be solved to obtain the position vs time graph. Taking the first and second derivatives would yield the velocity and acceleration graph, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                 By simulating different gear ratios, I was able to determine the ideal output torque. Taking into account our tire's estimated coefficient of friction and ideal slip ratio (tires operate best at a certain slip ratio, typically around 10%-20%), 
                I was able to determine the ideal torque to be around 575 Nm. This allows us to achieve strong acceleration, prevent excessive slippage, and achieve our goal of 100+ mph. Our team will be using a ZF75-7 motor, which has a peak torque of 110 Nm and approximately 60 horsepower.
                This means that a 5.2 : 1 gear ratio is needed

            <p>
                Given the required 5.2 : 1 reduction, using a single stage drivetrain isn't feasible due how excessively large the rear sprocket would need to be.
                Therefore, we decided on a two-stage system with an 18:10 ratio between the motor and jackshaft and a 43:19 ratio between the jackshaft and wheel. 
                This ultimately left us with a 5.16 : 1 reduction, very close to ideal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary design challenge was the lack of packaging space. We needed to avoid interference with the battery and suspension while maintaining structural integrity and optimal anti-squat geometry (more on this in the next section).
            </p>
            <p>
                The final configuration I came up with mounts the motor as low as possible, just slightly above the bottom fairing of the stock ZX-6R. This leaves more room for the battery and BMS and makes it easier to direct airflow to the motor for cooling purposes later on. 
                The jackshaft location is parameterized relative to the suspension pivot for easy anti-squat tuning. The material I selected for the motor mounts was 1/4" sheet metal due to its low cost and ease of manufacturing. With free access to our school's waterjet cutter, I'm able to quickly design different prototypes at a low cost.
